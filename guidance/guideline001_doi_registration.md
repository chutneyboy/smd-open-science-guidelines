# Registration of DOIs for data citation

These guidelines recommend that NASA data repositories use DOIs as persistent identifiers to facilitate citation of data in the scientific literature. 

The guidelines provide an overview of the scenarios in which NASA data repositories may need to register a DOI and the mechanisms through which they can do so. They provide guidance on the registration process and appropriate roles. The intent is to identify services and define a process that allow data repositories the flexibility they need to respond to the needs of their user communities while also enabling the creation of a central NASA registry of DOIs managed through the Scientific and Technical Information (STI) Program Office.

For more details on the precise scope of the guideline, supporting policy, general context, and maintenance plans, see the [full Request For Comment](smd-open-science-guidelines/request_for_comment/draft/RFC_001_data_citation_identifier.md).

## Primary Guidance:
1. NASA SMD-funded data intended or used for citation in the scientific literature should have a DOI registered through a NASA-designated DOI registration authority. As of January 2023, DataCite is the NASA-designated DOI registration as DataCite provides the only DOI Registration Authority and metadata schema suitable for data. 
1. All DOI requests for SMD-funded data should be processed through the NASA data repository that is responsible for archiving and distributing the digital object for which the DOI is being requested. Thus, PIs, science teams, and other data providers should contact the appropriate data repository to request a DOI. No data repository will be expected to issue a DOI for data that it does not manage or preserve.
1. Metadata requirements for the registration of a DOI should be met by the data repository in collaboration with data providers.
1. The data repository should be responsible for maintaining the metadata for the digital object as well as the landing page and resolvability of the DOI, as determined by leading practices in their discipline (see references in the RFC).
1. Data repositories should establish their own guidelines on what is required to register and maintain a DOI including how changes to data, different versions of data, and deprecated data will be addressed.
1. There are three DOI registration options appropriate for different scenarios:
	1. Contact NASA STI and request DOI services (see [https://nasa.sharepoint.com/sites/dpiservices](https://nasa.sharepoint.com/sites/dpiservices)  - accessible to NASA employees). This the recommended solution for data repositories needing very few DOI services in a year - few enough that a manual process for creating or updating DOIs is not onerous.
	1. Join the SMD-wide DataCite Consortium Membership (see [https://nasa.sharepoint.com/sites/dpiservices](https://nasa.sharepoint.com/sites/dpiservices)  - accessible to NASA employees).  Data repositories expecting a higher volume of DOI requests and looking to incorporate DOI services into automated workflows should consider this option. The majority of data repositories would most likely benefit from this option of working with an organization that has broad experience in supporting DOI services through DataCite.  
	1. Become a Direct Member of DataCite. Data repositories should consider this option only if they are also planning to become active participants in DataCite governance because it will give them a specific voice in DataCite and its myriad activities and partnerships beyond the general NASA consortium membership.

## Implementation
* STI has the vendor relationship with DataCite for the NASA Consortium Membership and is able to work with the data repositories who provide the metadata and assign the DOIs to specified data collections. 
* Data repositories not currently assigning DOIs will need to develop processes to do so. STI can help with this (see [https://nasa.sharepoint.com/sites/dpiservices](https://nasa.sharepoint.com/sites/dpiservices)  - accessible to NASA employees). 
* Data repositories currently assigning DOIs need to consider their relationship with DataCite and consider taking advantage of the NASA Consortium Membership.
